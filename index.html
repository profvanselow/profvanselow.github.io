<em><strong>BRIEF BIO</strong><br /> </em>

<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>TEACHING PHILOSOPHY</strong></em></p>
<p>The goal of my teaching is to provide students with tools to improve their lives, and the world. </p>
  <p> A major influence of my teaching philosophy is the Knowles' theory of andragogy.  Specifically, I agree with the assumptions that: (1) Adults need to know why they need to learn something, (2) Adults need to learn experientially, (3) Adults approach learning as problem-solving, and (4) Adults learn best when the topic is of immediate value.</p>
 <p>  With that theory in mind, my teaching philosophy can be outlined with these five words: preparation, retention, inspiration, connection, and engagement. </p>
<p>
Preparation</p>
<p>   My biggest motivation as a teacher is to adequately prepare students for the next level, whether that is the next course in their program sequence, an internship, full time employment, or something else. I have an introduction discussion assignment in each class where I have them share their intended major, career plans, and goals for the class. I research “what’s next” for different pathways and aid the transition. This allows me to share why they need to learn what they are learning in my classes and increases their learning. </p>
  <p> I enjoy aligning curriculum with industry certification exams when possible. This motivates students to prepare for the exam throughout the semester. When they pass the exam, they feel a great sense of accomplishment in knowing they are verifiably preparing for their career. </p>
<p>
Retention</p>
 <p>  Another key aspect of my teaching philosophy is retention. I take active measures to keep students in my classes and in college. One way I do this is by sharing research about grit and growth mindset. Another way I seek to retain students is by sharing statistics about the benefits of a college degree and having them research careers and job requirements. Thinking about the finish line makes it easier to run the race.  </p>
<p>   Especially early in the semester, I remind students about upcoming assignments and offer extensive guidance to get them started. When students don’t submit an assignment I contact them individually to see how they are doing and offer support. I care about the success of my students.</p>
<p>   I am open to teaching in any modality and any time of the day to best serve the student population and allow them to stay in and complete their program.  </p>
<p>
Inspiration</p>
<p>   Above all, I aim to inspire. </p>
<p>   I like the philosophy of Don Finkel from “Teaching with Your Mouth Shut”. I don’t teach by telling. I am not the “sage on the stage”. I design experiences that lead to discovery of the conceptual material. I create conditions that inspire students to learn. </p>
<p>   It used to be that teachers and textbooks were the holders of information and they imparted it to students. Now, nearly all information is freely accessible on the Internet and technology books are outdated the day they are published. I feel it is my role to inspire students to want to learn and help them to effectively be able to do so throughout their lives. </p>
<p>   I teach problem solving skills, creative thinking, and research techniques. I want to teach students to think like a software engineer. I emphasize effective search techniques and web site evaluations in all classes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Connection</p>
  <p> I believe the most important component of my teaching philosophy is connection. I strive to develop communication skills and to foster a connection between myself and each student, connections between the students, and connections with industry. I treat students like fellow human beings. I am cognizant of their stress levels and try to help them learn stress management techniques. While learning, I want them to also have fun and find fulfillment in life.</p>
  <p> It is important to me to develop the communication skills of my students, especially among this generation that is more comfortable texting than talking to the person sitting next to them, and engineering students who often tend to be introverted and shy. I share that the best engineer will be of no value to a company if they cannot work with stakeholders to understand requirements, collaborate with a team, and effectively provide and receive feedback.  </p>
  <p> I foster a connection between myself and each student by getting to know them and individually addressing each one by name in every class, even if just to say hello or goodbye. I share my mobile number with my students and tell them to call or text any time.  </p>  
<p>   I foster connections between students by having them engage in small group discussions and encouraging them to responsibly collaborate on most assignments. </p>
 <p>  I foster connections with professionals by personally attending and offering students bonus points for going to Southwest Florida Regional Technology Partnership events and bringing in guest speakers like the CIO of Capital One.</p>
<p>   “It’s not the grades you make, it’s the hands you shake.” </p>

<p>Engagement</p>
 <p>  In my class meetings, students learn experientially. They engage with one another and one on one with me. When possible, I utilize a flipped classroom. To me, it does not make sense in this age for a teacher to stand in front of a classroom full of students with different skills and learning preferences and deliver a lecture. This could more easily and effectively be delivered in a video recording. I prefer to create learning resources that the student can engage in at their convenience and then deliver personalized just-in-time teaching as students do their “home” work in class meetings.
